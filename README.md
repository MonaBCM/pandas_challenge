Data
The analysis performed among 15 schools (8 charter and 7district). Two separate data obtained. The first data consists of 39170 students’ math and reading grades, student name, id , gender, and their school grades. The second data consist of list of schools, type, size and their budget.
Analysis Performed:
1.	Total budget
2.	Average math, reading and overall grades per schools along with passing percentage of math, reading and overall grades (passing grade is 70 and over)
3.	Comparison of school budget per student 
4.	 Comparison of school sizes and success rate 
5.	Comparison of school types and success rate
6.	Comparison of student grades(age)
Results:
Total budget is 24,649,428
Average math score is 78.9% vs passing average math 74.98%
Average reading score is 81.87% vs passing average is 85.81%
Overall passing rate is 65.17%
The percentage of student passed both math and reading rate is 65.1%

When  the highest performing schools compared to the  lowest performing ones the data indicated following findings:
•	Highest performing schools are all Charter Schools and lowest performing schools are all District schools. This leaded to measure relationship between school type and student success rate. The analysis demonstrated that Charter schools students are performing better than District schools in all areas.
 
 

•	Data showed that school size and student success are negatively correlated. When school size gets smaller, student success rate increases
 
•	When we looked at the school budgets to understand whether there is any relationship between school budgets and student success rate; the data demonstrated that the school budget considering all the other things being equal, has little contribution to student success. Contrary, successful schools’ spending per student is lowest, less than $585 per student, and lower ranking schools spendings are higher ,&645 -680 per student.(see below)
  
•	Finally, the analysis between student grades provides the same pattern with one distinction that math score is the main driver of the overall success of schools. Charter schools students are more successful in Math than District school students. 
 
This concludes that based on available information, the highest contribution to student success is school sizes. Smaller size schools are outperformed larger schools even when their spending per capita is lower.
